```lrc
[00:22.73] A rattlesnake kiss, a buzz you get
[00:26.12] When the whiskey burns and the nicotine hits
[00:30.14] The devil you know, a taillight glow
[00:33.81] Yeah, a heartbreak kid when you're moving too slow, come on
[01:03.31] 
[00:53.19] The restless win, you can't fence in
[00:56.68] That barb on the wire, that wild in the horse
[01:00.52] When you hear that train, when the sirens ring
[01:04.54] Better batten down, baby, it's a hell of storm
[01:27.54] 
[01:08.23] Hey-hey, oh-oh
[01:11.42] I'm a renegade rebel with my pedal to the floor
[01:15.99] Hey-hey, oh-oh
[01:18.82] Them boys don't know I ain't in Kansas anymore
[01:23.64] Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na
[01:28.18] Hell nah, I ain't in Kansas anymore (I ain't in Kansas anymore)
[01:32.06] Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na
[01:48.06] 
[01:38.72] A movie scene, a fever dream
[01:42.42] When you catch your breath, you can come back down
[01:46.08] You're torn apart like a trailer park
[01:49.89] But you still can't wait 'til I come back around
[02:13.89] 
[01:53.70] Hey-hey, oh-oh
[01:56.64] I'm a renegade rebel with my pedal to the floor
[02:01.77] Hey-hey, oh-oh
[02:04.67] Them boys don't know I ain't in Kansas anymore
[02:09.19] Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na
[02:13.43] Hell nah, I ain't in Kansas anymore
[02:17.28] Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na
[02:33.28] 
[02:23.69] Hey-hey (hey-hey), oh-oh (oh-oh)
[02:27.86] I'm a renegade rebel with my pedal to the floor
[02:31.83] Hey-hey (hey-hey), oh-oh (oh-oh)
[02:35.74] Them boys don't know I ain't in Kansas anymore (come on)
[02:39.55] Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na (oh)
[02:43.97] Hell nah, I ain't in Kansas anymore (hey-hey, oh-oh)
[02:47.85] Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na (Kansas anymore)
