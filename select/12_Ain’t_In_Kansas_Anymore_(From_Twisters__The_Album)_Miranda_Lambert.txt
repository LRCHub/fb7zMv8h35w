A rattlesnake kiss, a buzz you get
When the whiskey burns and the nicotine hits
The devil you know, a taillight glow
Yeah, a heartbreak kid when you're moving too slow, come on
The restless wind, you can't fence in
That barb on the wire, that wild in the horse
When you hear that train, when the sirens ring
Better batten down, baby, it's a hell of storm
Hey-hey, oh-oh
I'm a renegade rebel with my pedal to the floor
Hey-hey, oh-oh
Them boys don't know I ain't in Kansas anymore
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Hell nah, I ain't in Kansas anymore (I ain't in Kansas anymore)
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
A movie scene, a fever dream
When you catch your breath, you can come back down
You're torn apart like a trailer park
But you still can't wait 'til I come back around
Hey-hey, oh-oh
I'm a renegade rebel with my pedal to the floor
Hey-hey, oh-oh
Them boys don't know I ain't in Kansas anymore
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Hell nah, I ain't in Kansas anymore
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey-hey (hey-hey), oh-oh (oh-oh)
I'm a renegade rebel with my pedal to the floor
Hey-hey (hey-hey), oh-oh (oh-oh)
Them boys don't know I ain't in Kansas anymore (come on)
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na (oh-oh)
Hell nah, I ain't in Kansas anymore (hey-hey, oh-oh)
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Kansas anymore)
